　　本来此刻想想那些事，真的太纯真，也太愚笨，说过的话语，咱们都没能逐一实现，就顺着循环的脚步一圈一圈褪色在故事里。
　　爱上笔墨，即是爱上本人，即是把本人精神深处的每一片白月色都流逝得白而纯洁...我将那一脉脉精神的甘泉，泼洒在长长的指尖。我的心跟着笔墨的震动而渐渐宁靖。我静静地享用着笔墨的宁静功夫，让我倍感轻快欣喜。享用一份爱的感念；一份笔墨的芳香。

Originally this moment think about those things, really is too pure, too stupid, said the words, let's have failed to achieve one by fade down the circulation in the footsteps of a circle a circle in the story.
Fall in love with pen and ink, and is in love with himself, is to oneself the depths of the spirit of every piece of white moonlight passes very white and pure...
I will be the spirit of the affectionately oasis, splashing in the long fingers.
My heart follow the vibration of the pen and ink NingJing gradually.
I peace of kung fu, quietly enjoying a ink let me feel more light.
Enjoy a love concept;
A scent of ink.
